# Forum SystemsThis is a repo for managing machine readable artifacts for the [Forum Systems APIs](http://www.forumsys.com/en/homepage/). The goal is to maintain and evolve an OpenAPI, Postman Collection, and APIs.json index for the [Forum Systems APIs](http://www.forumsys.com/en/homepage/).They are a constant work in progress, and will be updated on a regular basis when new information is added, or more of the specifications are supported.Feel free to submit a pull request to evolve any of the artifacts, and leave GitHub issues if you have any questions, comments, or feedback.- [Website](http://www.forumsys.com/en/homepage/)- [Developer](http://www.forumsys.com/en/homepage/)- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ForumSystems)The [APIs.json](https://github.com/api-evangelist/forum-systems/blob/master/apis.json) index provides links to all the relevant links for the Forum Systems APIs, including the OpenAPI and Postman if they are present.
